# GAMES MAP

Living document. Update whenever a game is added, removed, or its shared
deps / `NOTES.md` status changes.

Purpose: read this **before** opening any file under `public/games/` or
`public/data/`. It tells you which single folder a game lives in, so a
task scoped to one game never needs to read another game's code. See
`AGENTS.md` Section 1 ("Game-scoped work") for the isolation rule this
map exists to support.

## Wordpack games

Share one engine: `wordplayer.html` + `wordplayer.js` (root, Vite-bundled)
+ `public/shared/js/engine.js` (see `shared/CONTRACT.md`). To edit one
game's content, touch **only its data file** — never the engine, unless
the change must apply to every wordpack game at once.

| id | data file |
|---|---|
| `pictionary` | `public/data/pictionary/pictionary_words.json` |
| `taboo` | `public/data/taboo/taboo_words.json` |
| `esquisse` | `public/data/esquisse/esquisse_words.json` |
| `pigeonpigeon` | `public/data/pigeonpigeon/pigeonpigeon_words.json` |

Flag: `public/games/pictionary/index.html` + `main.js` are orphaned —
`hub-config.json` launches Pictionary via `wordplayer.html?game=pictionary`,
not this folder. Pre-existing dead code, left untouched per `AGENTS.md`.

## Custom games (own folder, own code, launched standalone)

| id | folder | main file(s) — lines | shared deps | `NOTES.md`? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `blackstories` | `public/games/blackstories/` | `blackstories.js` (251) | header, profile | no |
| `olemains` | `public/games/olemains/` | 6 files, ~510 total (already split, none >300) | engine, header, profile | no |
| `cafards` | `public/games/cafards/` | `game.js` (238) | header, profile | no |
| `millionaire` | `public/games/millionaire/` | `app.js` (1069, **over 300-line limit**) | header, profile | no — see `docs/BACKLOG.md` |
| `pyramide` | `public/games/pyramide/` | `app.js` (847), `i18n.js` (317) — **both over limit** | header, profile | no — see `docs/BACKLOG.md` |
| `yatsy` | `public/games/yatsy/` | 14 files; `app.js` (1216), `i18n.js` (392), `render.js` (633), `session.js` (575) — **4 files over limit** | header, profile, Supabase | no — see `docs/BACKLOG.md` Later |
| `diceduel` | `public/games/diceduel/js/` | `engine.js` (327), `ui.js` (303) — both just over limit | header, profile | no |

"Shared deps" = which `shared/CONTRACT.md` modules the game imports. Read
that contract, not the shared source, unless it doesn't answer your
question.

## External games (launch is a plain URL, `kind: "external"` in `hub-config.json`)

"External" describes how a game **launches** (a URL, not an in-repo
page) — independent of where its *code* physically lives. Two different
situations exist today:

### Colocated (code lives in this repo, under `apps/`)

`coinchapp` and `tranquil` were imported via `git subtree` on 2026-09-17
(full history preserved) so their code, history, and docs sit in this
repo for easier LLM context — see `docs/DECISIONS.md`. **They are not
part of the hub-spoke/vanilla-JS architecture**: each is a separate,
self-governing project (own `package.json`, own `AGENTS.md`, own
lint/build) and is explicitly excluded from this repo's root
lint/format/build (`eslint.config.mjs`, `.prettierignore`). Read *that
app's own* `AGENTS.md`/`STATE.md` before working inside it, not this
repo's game-scoped rules.

| id (in `hub-config.json`) | code lives at | still deploys at (unchanged so far) |
|---|---|---|
| `tranquil` | `apps/tranquil/` (npm workspaces: `shared` + `client` + `api`) | tranquil-woad.vercel.app, its own Vercel project |
| `coinche`, `bouilla`, `president`, `bataillecorse` | `apps/coinchapp/` (Next.js App Router) | coinchapp.vercel.app, its own Vercel project |

Colocating the code did **not** move the deployment on its own: Vercel
repointing is being done separately, app by app (`coinchapp`'s is in
progress — see `docs/BACKLOG.md` — `tranquil`'s has not started). Hub
tile thumbnails for these games stay where they always were, unaffected
by this: `public/games/coinchapp/assets/` and
`public/games/tranquil/assets/`.

**Local task orchestration** (build/lint caching, not deployment) uses
Turborepo (`turbo.json`, root `package.json`): `npm run build:all` /
`lint:all` run the hub's + `coinchapp`'s tasks with caching. `tranquil`
is excluded from this — it has its own nested npm workspaces
(`shared`+`client`), which cannot nest inside the root's; it keeps
building itself independently. See `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-09-17.

### Not colocated (code lives in a separate, untouched repo)

| id | deployed at | repo |
|---|---|---|
| `easyfrog` | easyfrog.web.app | separate, not tracked here |
| `gameboy-web` | gameboy-web.vercel.app | `gameboy-web` |

## Adding a new game

Follow `docs/NEW_GAME.md` — the full checklist (technical + visual
conventions, hub-config.json schema, verification steps). It ends with:
add one row to this file, and add a `NOTES.md` in the game's folder once
its main file passes ~150–200 lines (a short summary of what an agent
needs before editing, so future edits can skip reading the full source;
below that size, the code itself is the doc).
